`@chakra-ui/react@2.2.0`

- Ensure components show focus outline only when interacting with the keyboard.
- Migrate components to use `_focusVisible` instead of `_focus` selectors to
  indicate focus.

ðŸš¨ NOTE: This might be a potential breaking change for consumers who use the
`extendTheme` with the `_focus` styles. Kindly migrate to `_focusVisible`.- Bump all packages to resolve deps issues

**Media Query** `v3.1.0`

- Add support for client-side rendered (CSR) apps to get the correct value on
  first render.

> Affected hooks: `useMediaQuery`, `useBreakpoint`, `useBreakpointValue`.

These hooks are built work in server-side rendering (SSR) applications by
default. You might notice a quick flash of incorrect media query value when you
use them.

If you're creating a CSR-only app, you can now leverage the `ssr` argument to
get the correct value on first render.

```jsx live=false
const [isMobile] = useMediaQuery('(max-width: 768px)', {
  // you can now pass `ssr: false`
  ssr: false,
});

const buttonSize = useBreakpointValue(
  { base: 'sm', lg: 'md' },
  // you can now pass `ssr: false`
  { ssr: false }
);

// you can now pass `ssr: false`
const breakpoint = useBreakpoint({ ssr: false });
```

- New watch flag for the tokens command. You can specify a directory path to watch
  for changes. It defaults to the parent dir of `<source>`, e.g.
  `src/theme/theme.ts` => `src/theme`.

```shell
> chakra-cli tokens src/theme/theme.ts --watch

> chakra-cli tokens --help
Usage: chakra-cli tokens [options] <source>

Options:
  --out <path>              output file e.g. node_modules/@chakra-ui/styled-system/dist/declarations/src/theming.types.d.ts
  --strict-component-types  Generate strict types for props variant and size
  --watch [path]            Watch directory for changes and rebuild
  -h, --help                display help for command

```

- Fixed an issue where the tokens command failed with
  `SyntaxError: Undefined label 'e'`.
