There's neat little `next.config.js` approach to improve how Chakra components
are bundled in your Next.js applications.

```js live=false
/**
 * moves everything @chakra-ui related into the framework chunk instead of
 * duplicating in routes
 *
 * @see https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/examples/using-preact/next.config.js
 */
const bundleChakraOnce = ({ config, isServer }) => {
  const splitChunks = config.optimization && config.optimization.splitChunks

  if (splitChunks) {
    const cacheGroups = splitChunks.cacheGroups
    const test = /[\\/]node_modules[\\/](@chakra-ui)[\\/]/
    if (cacheGroups.framework) {
      cacheGroups.preact = Object.assign({}, cacheGroups.framework, { test })
      // if you want to merge the 2 small commons+framework chunks:
      // cacheGroups.commons.name = 'framework';
    }
  }

  if (isServer) {
    // mark @chakra-ui stuff as external for server bundle to prevent duplicates
    config.externals.push(/^(@chakra-ui)/)
  }
}
```

## Pros

Chakra is only downloaded once per build per user. without this optimization,
chakra will be copied into each pages bundle

## Cons

Your user downloads all chakra component used in the website or application at
once.

By default, Next.js treeshakes any Chakra component you don't use throughout
your application but on a per page basis.

This approach ensures Next.js treeshakes Chakra components globally and keep
them all in one place. This might affect the iniital load time but navigating
will be faster.
