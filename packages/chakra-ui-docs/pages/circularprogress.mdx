# Circular Progress

Circular Progress is used to indicates a wait time for deterministic actions -
either within an experience flow or loading data.

Circular progress support both determinate and indeterminate processes.

- Determinate circular indicators fill the circular track with color, as the
  indicator moves from 0 to 360 degrees.
- Indeterminate circular indicators grow and shrink in size while moving along
  the circular track.

## Usage

```js
import { CircularProgress } from "@chakra-ui/core";
```

```jsx
<CircularProgress value={80} />
```

### Changing the size

You can add `size` prop to the progressbar to add a custom size.

```jsx
// Change the size to 120px
<CircularProgress value={30} size="120px" />
```

### Changing the thickness

You can add `thickness` prop to update the thicknessof the progress ring.

> The thickness has to be a ratio of the size. Value should be between 0 and 1.

```jsx
// 10% of size => 10px
<CircularProgress value={59} size="100px" thickness={0.1} />
```

### Changing the color

You can add `color` prop to any progressbar to apply any color that exists in
the theme.

```jsx
<CircularProgress value={30} color="orange" thickness={0.1} />
```

### Adding label

Chakra exports a `CircularProgressLabel` to help you add label. Pass this
component as children and you'll be able to render the value

```jsx
<CircularProgress value={40} color="green">
  <CircularProgressLabel>40%</CircularProgressLabel>
</CircularProgress>
```

### Indeterminate Progress

Setting the progress to `indeterminate` means you're not able to determinate the
`value` upfront, so won't need to pass the `value` prop.

```jsx
<CircularProgress isIndeterminate color="green"></CircularProgress>
```

### Accessibility

- Progress has a `role` set to `progressbar` to denote that it's a progress`
- Progress has `aria-valuenow` set to the percentage completion value passed to
  the component, to ensure the progress percent is visible to screen readers.

> **ARIA:** If the progress bar is describing the loading progress of a
> particular region of a page, you should use `aria-describedby` to point to the
> progress bar, and set the `aria-busy` attribute to `true` on that region until
> it has finished loading.
