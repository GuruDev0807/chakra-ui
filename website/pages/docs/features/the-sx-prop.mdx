The sx prop lets you style components inline, using your theme tokens.

## Use cases

Although the `sx` prop is considered an escape hatch, there are few cases where it is needed.

### Defining Any Standard CSS Property

In case you need to set a CSS property that is not listed in the [Style Props](/docs/features/style-props) list,
you can use the `sx` prop and pass it whatever CSS property you desire.

One such example is the `filter` property:

```jsx
<Image
  src="http://placekitten.com/200/300"
  alt="a kitten"
  sx={{ filter: "blur(8px)" }}
/>
```

### Defining CSS Custom Properties

Custom CSS properties can be defined via the `sx` prop as well:

```jsx
<Box sx={{ "--my-color": "#53c8c4" }}>
  <Heading color="var(--my-color)" size="lg">
    This uses CSS Custom Properties!
  </Heading>
</Box>
```

### Creating Nested Selectors

To create complex, nested selectors, you can use utilize the `&` operator.
The `&` in selector will get resolved to unique `className` that is assigned the component you put `sx` on.

> For simple examples like the following, you could just use the [`_groupHover` shorthand prop](/docs/features/style-props#pseudo).
> However, that way you can't create nested groups, for example.

```jsx
<Box borderWidth={2} borderColor="purple.500" p={5} className="my-box">
  <Heading size="lg">
    Hover the box...
    <Box
      as="span"
      color="red.500"
      sx={{
        ".my-box:hover &": {
          color: "green.500"
        }
      }}
    >
      And I will turn green!
    </Box>
  </Heading>
</Box>
```
