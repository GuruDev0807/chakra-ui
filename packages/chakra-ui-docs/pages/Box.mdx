# Box

Box is the most abstract component on top of which all other Chakra UI
components are built. By default, it renders a div element

The Box component is the most fundamental component in Chakra UI. It is
primitive used to construct layouts and compose components. In most cases you
can use a `Box` instead of a div element.

**The Box component is useful because it helps with 3 common use cases:**

- Create responsive layouts without writing CSS.
- Provide a shorthand way to define styles (`bg` instead of `backgroundColor`).
- Compose new component and allow for override using the `as` prop.

## You don’t need `className`

With Chakra UI, you don’t deal with CSS classes through the className property.
Instead, you write CSS properties directly onto your Chakra UI components — in
most cases it will just work.

Here's how it works:

```jsx
<Box
  p={5}
  width={["100%", "50%", "25%", "15%"]}
  color={["white", "yellow.300", "papayawhip"]}
  bg="green.500"
>
  Box
</Box>
```

## You don’t need to write media queries

With Chakra UI, Use array values to quickly and ergonomically add mobile-first
responsive styles to specific properties. This works on all style props and the
sx prop. See the Styled System docs for more.

```jsxCodeOnly
<Box
  width={[
    "100%",  // Extra small devices (portrait phones, less than 480px)
    "50%",  // Small devices (landscape phones, 480px and up)
    "25%",  // Medium devices (tablets, 768px and up)
    "15%"   // Large devices (desktops, 992px and up)
  ]}
/>
```

## Usage

```jsx
<Box>
  Box can be used to create both{" "}
  <Box as="span" bg="green.100">
    inline
  </Box>
  and
  <Box bg="blue.100">block-level elements,</Box>
  <Box bg="purple.100" width={["100%", "75%", 1 / 2]}>
    elements with fixed or responsive width and height,
  </Box>
  <Box bg="yellow.50" p={4} mt={2}>
    and more!
  </Box>
</Box>
```

### `as` prop

You can use the `as` prop to change the element render, just like
styled-components.

```jsx
// import { Box } from "@chakra-ui/Box";

function Example() {
  return <Box as="button">Button</Box>;
}
```
