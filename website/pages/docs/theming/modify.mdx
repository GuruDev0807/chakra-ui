Chakra's theming system is quite simple for modifying styles of existing Chakra
components (`Box`, `Tabs`, `Accordion`, etc). However, you're not limited to the
components that Chakra supplies - we have documentation on how to build your own
components, and allow them to be theme-aware,
[in later documentation](/docs/theming/create).

## Modifying a single component

If we want to modify the styles of components that come with Chakra, we must
first start by creating a main `theme.js` (or `theme.ts`) file:

```jsx live=false
// theme.js
import theme from "@chakra-ui/theme"

export default theme
```

You can then later import this theme inside of your main `ChakraProvider`
component at the root of your project:

```jsx live=false
// App.js
import React from "react"
import { ChakraProvider } from "@chakra-ui/core"

import theme from "./theme"

function App() {
  return (
    <ChakraProvider resetCSS theme={theme}>
      <App />
    </ChakraProvider>
  )
}
```

Fantastic! But we're not doing anything with this theme. First, make sure you
have `@chakra-ui/utils` installed:

```bash
npm i @chakra-ui/utils@next

# or

yarn add @chakra-ui/utils@next
```

Then, let's override the default `fontSize` of the Chakra `<Button>` component:

```jsx live=false
// theme.js
import theme from "@chakra-ui/theme"

// 1. Import the merge function from @chakra-ui/utils
import { merge } from "@chakra-ui/utils"

// 2. Define the changes you want to make for the button
const Button = {
  baseStyle: {
    fontWeight: "bold", // Normally, it's "semibold"
  },
}

// 3. Import the Button styles into the theme.components object
const overrides = {
  components: {
    Button,
  },
}

// 4. Export the merge between the default theme at @chakra-ui/theme, combined with your overrides
export default merge(theme, overrides)
```

And that's it!

## Modifying the theme

Not only does this apply to components, but you can also override the core theme
settings themselves.

Let's say that I want to modify what borders are available to me in my project.
Following the same logic as before, I could add another border to the existing
set of borders like such:

```jsx live=false
// theme.js
import theme from "@chakra-ui/theme"
import { merge } from "@chakra-ui/utils"

/*
  Remember, borders already contains the following keys:

  const borders = {
    none: 0,
    "1px": "1px solid",
    "2px": "2px solid",
    "4px": "4px solid",
  }
*/

const overrides = {
  borders: {
    "8px": "8px solid",
  },
}

/*
  This will produce:

  const borders = {
    none: 0,
    "1px": "1px solid",
    "2px": "2px solid",
    "4px": "4px solid",
    "8px": "8px solid",
  }
*/
export default merge(theme, overrides)
```

And now, we can use that `border` definition in any component we'd like:

```jsx live=false
<Box border="8px" borderColor="red.500">
  Thick red border
</Box>
```

## Scaling out your project

As your project grows in size, it's best to keep things organized. We highly
suggest that instead of a single `theme.js` (or `theme.ts`) file, that you
create a `/theme` folder in its place. Inside of this folder, you could have a
directory structure that looks like such:

```bash
/theme
  - index.js # my main theme entrypoint
  - button.js # all my button overrides
```

This way, you can structure your main theme entrypoint file to be much cleaner,
like this:

```jsx live=false
// theme.js
import theme from "@chakra-ui/theme"
import { merge } from "@chakra-ui/utils"
import Button from "./button"

const overrides = {
  components: {
    Button,
    // Other components go here...
  },
}

export default merge(theme, overrides)
```

[In the next section](/docs/theming/create), we'll show some examples of how to
create your own components and integrate them into the Chakra system!
