# Avatars

Use round avatars to quickly identify users. Use rounded square avatars to help
identify large product entities like projects, spaces, groups, rooms, or
repositories.

The Avatar export 2 Components:

- `Avatar`: This houses the image that represents the user or entity. When an
  image hasn't been uploaded, a default image will be displayed. For users that
  haven't uploaded an image, you can display their initials instead.

- `AvatarBadge`: In some products, you can display a badge on the avatar. For
  instance, an avatar can show if the user is online.

## Style

Avatars are available in 6 sizes.

## Default user avatars

When no image is available for a user avatar, user initials are used in place of
an image.

If the initials cannot be rendered (such as names that do not use latin
characters), a default silhouette is shown instead.

### Invalid avatars

When an avatar is unavailable (for example, due to an image error) a default
avatar is shown.
