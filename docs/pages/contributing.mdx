# Contributing to Chakra UI

Thanks for being interested in contributing! We're so glad you want to help!

We want contributing to Chakra UI to be enjoyable, and educational for anyone
and everyone. All contributions are welcome, including issues, new docs as well
as updates and tweaks, blog posts, workshops, and more.

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish
to make via issue, email, or any other method with the owners of this repository
before making a change.

Please note we have a code of conduct, please follow it in all your interactions
with the project.

## Getting started

Please create a new branch from an up to date master on your fork. (Note, urgent
hotfixes should be branched off the latest stable release rather than master)

- Fork the Chakra UI repository on Github
- Clone your fork to your local machine
  `git clone git@github.com:<yourname>/chakra-ui.git`
- Create a branch `git checkout -b my-feature-branch`
- Make your changes, lint, then push to to GitHub with
  `git push --set-upstream origin my-feature-branch`.
- Visit GitHub and make your pull request.

If you have an existing local repository, please update it before you start, to
minimise the chance of merge conflicts.

```sh
git remote add upstream git@github.com:chakra-ui/chakra-ui.git
git checkout master
git pull upstream master
git checkout -b my-feature-branch
```

## Docs contribution

Chakra UI uses NextJS for its documentation website. Thank you in advance and
cheers for contributing to our documentation! We created a simple command to run
it.

```sh
npm run docs
```

You can now access the documentation site locally. Changes to the docs will hot
reload the site.

### Documentation Goals

As an organization, we've established a few goals for our documentation in order
to keep them accessible, friendly, and useful.

- Docs should be friendly and human

Our documentation should be accessible to everyone, regardless of their skill
level with React. This means we should try to write documentation that someone
totally new to React can get started with.

It also means that we want the voice of our docs to be simple and casual. We
want people to fall in love with Chakra and have fun with it, and our docs
should reflect that desire!

- Cover FAQs and common issues

Chakra has a lot going on with it! In order to help users as much as possible,
we want our documentation to cover frequently asked questions and common issues.

- Copy-able

Code snippets should be easily copied and pasted. We should also try to cover as
many use cases as possible for each component, so that users can learn by code
example as much as they can by reading through the docs.
