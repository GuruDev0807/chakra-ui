# Style Props

Style props are a way to alter the style of a component by simply passing props
to it. It helps to save time by providing helpful shorthand ways to style
components.

Chakra UI uses [Styled System](https://styled-system.com/) to achieve this. We
extend styled-system's utilities to provide other helpful shorthands.
