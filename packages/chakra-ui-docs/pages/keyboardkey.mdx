# Keyboard Key

The keyboard shortcut exists only to show which key or combination of keys
performs a given action. The action itself should be further explained in
accompanying content.

```jsx
<span>
  <KeyboardKey>shift</KeyboardKey> + <KeyboardKey>H</KeyboardKey>
</span>
```

## Guideline

All shortcuts should do their best to match what appears on the user’s keyboard.

- All single letters A-Z are uppercase.
- For non-letter keys such as enter, esc and shift, stick to lowercase.
- Use the arrow symbol as opposed to spelling things out.

## Modifer

The only punctuation you should need is the **+** to indicate a combination of
keys will activate the shortcut.

```jsx
<span>
  <KeyboardKey>shift</KeyboardKey> + <KeyboardKey>H</KeyboardKey>
</span>
```

For a sequence of keys where one must follow the other, spell out then. Stick to
lowercase to match the non-letter keys.

```jsx
<span>
  <KeyboardKey>shift</KeyboardKey> then <KeyboardKey>H</KeyboardKey>
</span>
```

If two different keys can execute the same action, or the shortcut itself may
look different on the user’s keyboard, insert or.

```jsx
<span>
  <KeyboardKey>alt</KeyboardKey> or <KeyboardKey>option</KeyboardKey>
</span>
```
