# Tabs

An accessible tabs component.

The `Tab` and `TabPanel` elements are associated by their order in the tree.
None of the components are empty wrappers, each is associated with a real DOM
element in the document, giving you maximum control over styling and
composition.

## Installation

```sh
npm i @chakra-ui/tabs
```
