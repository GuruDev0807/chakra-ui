# Component Theming

Writing component styles that are easy to maintain over the life of a growing
and changing project is a challenging task. To solve this, we need to have a
consistent and extensible approach.

Chakra provides a unified component-driven Styling API that makes it easy to
build your own customizable, theme-aware components.

<br />

> ðŸš¨ Heads up: This API is **completely optional** and should be used only when
> you need to customize or create component styles.

## Overview

Most components we build today consists of multiple parts, we refer to these
components as **"composite components"**.

For example, if you want to style a button, you might need to style all its
parts:

- **Container:** the main button wrapper
- **Icon:** the icon to the left or right of the button

Due this common scenario, the theming API assumes that all components are
composite. Meaning they have multiple parts.

### Style modifiers

A reusable and themable component consists of the **base styles**, that acts as
the default styles, and **modifier styles** that alter the appearance of the
component.

The most common style modifiers are:

- **Size:** A component can have different sizes (e.g. small, medium, large)
- **Variant:** A component can different visual styles (e.g. outline, solid,
  ghost)
- **Color scheme:** For a given variant, a component can have different color
  schemes (e.g. an outline button with a red color scheme)
- **Color mode:** A component can change its visual styles based on color mode
  (e.g. light or dark).

## The Theming API

To recap, we mentioned that most components have the following attributes:

- Consist of multiple parts **(composite)**
- Have base or default styles **(baseStyle)**
- Might have size variations **(sizes)**
- Might have style variations **(variants)**

### The Parts

This is used as a way to document the anatomy of a composite component. It's
also useful to show what parts can be styled.

```jsx live=false
// To style a button
const parts = {
  container: "the button container",
  icon: "the button's left or right icon",
}
```

### The base style

This is used to specify the base or default styles for the component parts. The
styles passed can be **theme-aware** styles, **responsive** styles or regular
css style objects.

```jsx live=false
// To style a button
const baseStyle = {
  // base styles for the container
  container: {...},
  // base styles for the icon
  icon: {...},
}
```

### The sizes

This is used to specify the styles for the component parts, for each size
variation.

```jsx live=false
// To style a button
const sizes = {
  // styles for component parts when it's small
  sm: {
    container: {...},
    icon: {...},
  },
  // styles for component parts when it's large
  md: {
    container: {...},
    icon: {...},
  },
}
```

### The variants

This is used to specify the styles for the component parts, for each style
variation.

```jsx live=false
// To style a button
const variants = {
  // styles for component parts when it's solid
  solid: {
    container: {...},
    icon: {...},
  },
  // styles for component parts when it's outline
  outline: {
    container: {...},
    icon: {...},
  },
}
```

## Bringing it together

The final style configuration for a button component might look like this:

```js live=false
const buttonConfig = {
  parts : {
    container: "the button container",
    icon: "the button's left or right icon",
  },
  baseStyle: {
    container: {...},
    icon: {...},
  },
  sizes: {
    sm: {
      container: {...},
      icon: {...},
    },
    md: {
      container: {...},
      icon: {...},
    },
  },
  variants: {
    solid: {
      container: {...},
      icon: {...},
    },
    outline: {
      container: {...},
      icon: {...},
    },
  },
}
```

This API make styling components declarative, easy to maintain and update.

## Consuming the Style config

We created a custom hook that can consume this API and return the computed
styles for each component style for any `size` or `variant` passed.

This hook is called `useStyleConfig`, and here's how to use it.

```js live=false
const styles = useStyleConfig(themeKey, props)
```

**Arguments:**

- `themeKey`: The reference to the style config key in `theme.components`. This
  is used for global styling for components.
- `props`: The props object that includes `size`, `variant` values

**Returned value:** The computed styles for each component part is returned
depending on the `size` or `variant` passed.

You can consume the style configuration in two ways:

- Move it to the theme object (Global styling)
- Pass it directly to `useStyleConfig` (Local styling)

### Local component styles

**For this approach:**

- Save the component style config in a seperate file. For example
  `button.styles.js`
- Import it into the button component and pass it as part of the props object
  under the `styleConfig` key.

```jsx live=false
import buttonConfig from "./button.styles"

function Button(props) {
  const { size, variant, ...rest } = props

  const styles = useStyleConfig("Button", {
    styleConfig: buttonConfig,
    size,
    variant,
  })

  return (
    <Box as="button" sx={styles.container}>
      <PhoneIcon sx={styles.icon} />
      <span>Submit</span>
    </Box>
  )
}
```

### Global component styles

**For this approach:**

- Move the component styles to `theme.components.[name]`. For the button
  component, it'll be `theme.components.Button`.
- Pass the props object for `size`, `variant`, and `colorScheme` (optional)

```jsx live=false
// 1. Import the style config
import buttonConfig from "./button.styles"

// 2. Add it to the theme
const theme = {
  components: {
    Button: buttonConfig,
  },
}

// 3. Consume it
function Button(props) {
  const { size, variant, ...rest } = props

  // The themeKey "Button" gets the config from `theme.components.Button`
  const styles = useStyleConfig("Button", { size, variant })

  return (
    <Box as="button" sx={styles.container}>
      <PhoneIcon sx={styles.icon} />
      <span>Submit</span>
    </Box>
  )
}
```

In the next section, we'll show some real world examples!
