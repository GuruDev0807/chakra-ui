# Badges

Badges are used to highlight an item's status for quick recognition. Lozenges
are either 'subtle', 'solid' or 'outlines' and use color to indicate meanings
that users can learn and recognize across products.

Using the color system can help guide the usage for badges, and help keep a
consistent visual language.
