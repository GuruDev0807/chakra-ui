# Getting Started

## Adding Chakra to an existing app

You can install Chakra UI via npm or yarn. It relies on `emotion` and
`emotion-theming` (as well as React) being available in whatever project you are
working on.

```bash
  # Using npm
  npm install @chakra-ui/core @emotion/core @emotion/styled emotion-theming


  yarn add @chakra-ui/core @emotion/core @emotion/styled emotion-theming
```

## Configuring the theme

At the root of your application, you should tell your app which theme to use. In
most cases, you will want to use the default theme.

```jsxCodeOnly
import { Button, theme, ChakraProvider } from "@chakra-ui/core";

const App = () => (
  <ChakraProvider theme={theme}>
    <Button color="green">Click me</Button>
  </ChakraProvider>
);
```

## Using components

Simply import components by name from the @chakra-ui/core package, as
demonstrated above.

```bash
import {Button} from "@chakra-ui/core"
```

## Injecting global styles

Sometimes you may need to apply global styles to your page. Here is how you can
do this with the utilities provided by Chakra UI.

## Adding Icons

You can use custom icons from standard libraries like [react-icons](#) or you
can add the icon paths into the theme object.

Here's how the icon aspect of the theme object looks.

```js
// Theme object
export default {
  icons: {
    search: {
      // This is can be the <path/> or <g> elements for the svg. Note the "fill=currentColor"
      path: (
        <path
          fill="currentColor"
          d="M23.384,21.619,16.855,15.09a9.284,9.284,0,1,0-1.768,1.768l6.529,6.529a1.266,1.266,0,0,0,1.768,0A1.251,1.251,0,0,0,23.384,21.619ZM2.75,9.5a6.75,6.75,0,1,1,6.75,6.75A6.758,6.758,0,0,1,2.75,9.5Z"
        />
      ),
      // This is the viewBox of the icon.
      viewBox: "0 0 24 24",
    },
  },
};
```

Once you add the icons, you can then use them within the `Icon` component, like
this;

```jsx
<Icon name="search" color="red.500" />
```
