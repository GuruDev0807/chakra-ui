# Component Theming

Writing component styles that are easy to maintain over the life of a growing
and changing project is a challenging task. To solve this, we need to have a
simple and consistent system.

Chakra provides a unified component-driven CSS API that it builds its own
components with and makes it easy to build your own customizable, theme-aware
components.

<br />

> ðŸš¨ This API is **completely optional** and should be used only when you need
> to customize or create component styles.

## Overview

A reusable and themable component consists of the **base styles**, that acts as
the default styles, and **modifier styles** that alter the appearance of the
component.

The most common style modifiers are:

- **Size:** A component can have different sizes (e.g. small, medium, large)
- **Variant:** A component can different visual styles (e.g. outline, solid,
  ghost)
- **Color scheme:** For a given variant, a component can have different color
  schemes (e.g. an outline button with a red color scheme)
- **Color mode:** A component can change its visual styles based on color mode
  (e.g. light or dark).

## Theming local and global

- **Local.** Custom components can be themed locally using a `styled`-like API
- **Global.** Both Chakra and Custom components can be themed via the central
  chakra theme using `themeKey`

### Local Theming

In styled components, you usually do this:

```js live=false
const MyComponent = styled("div")({
  // any style you can imagine goes here
})
```

With chakra's theming API, we've defined a set of constraints to keep your
styles consistent and extensible.

```js live=false
const MyComponent = chakra("div", {
  // base or default styles
  baseStyle: {...},
  // styles for the different sizes
  sizes: {...},
  // styles for the different visual styles
  variants: {...},
  // attach props
  attrs: {...}
})
```

### Global Theming

The above is convenient for quickly creating custom themed components, but...

**What if you want to maintain your theme centrally?**

**What if you want to theme one of the out-of-the-box Chakra components?**

Let's answer both of these questions...

### Theme custom components from central theme

```jsx live=false
// 1. Use the `themeKey` option instead
const MyComponent = chakra("div", {
  themeKey: "MyComponent",
})

// 2. Move your styles to the theme under the `components.MyComponent` key
const theme = {
  components: {
    MyComponent: {
      defaultProps: {
        size: "small",
        variant: "solid",
      },
      baseStyle: { ... },
      sizes: {
        small: { ... },
        large: { ... },
      },
      variants: {
        solid: { ... },
        outline: { ... },
      },
    },
  },
}
```

### Theme out-of-the-box Chakra components from central theme

Every out-of-the-box Chakra component has its own `themeKey` available for
modification in the default theme. There you will find `defaultProps`,
`baseStyle`, `sizes`, `variants`, etc that can be tweaked as needed.

For example, to customize `Button` globally, find the `components.Button` object
and modify it.

```jsx live=false
const theme = {
  components: {
    Button: {
      defaultProps: { ... },
      baseStyle: { ... },
      sizes: { ... },
      variants: { ... },
    },
  },
}
```
