# Progress

Progress is used to display the progress status for a task that take a long time
or consists of several steps.

## Usage

```js
import { Progress } from "@chakra-ui/core";
```

```jsx
<Progress value={80} />
```

### Progress with Stripe

You can add `hasStripe` prop to any progressbar to apply a stripe via a CSS
gradient over the progress bar’s background color.

```jsx
<Progress hasStripe value={64} />
```

### Progress sizes

There are two ways you can increase the height of the progressbar:

- You can add `size` prop to increase the height of the progressbar.
- You can also use the `height` prop to manually set a height.

```jsx
<Stack spacing={5}>
  <Progress color="green" size="sm" value={20} />
  <Progress color="green" size="md" value={20} />
  <Progress color="green" size="lg" value={20} />
  <Progress color="green" height="32px" value={20} />
</Stack>
```

### Progress with theme color

You can add `color` prop to any progressbar to apply any color that exists in
the theme.

```jsx
<Progress color="pink" hasStripe />
```

### Animated Progress

The striped gradient can also be animated. Just add `isAnimated` and `hasStripe`
prop to the progressbar to animate the stripes right to left via CSS3
animations.

```jsx
<Progress hasStripe isAnimated />
```

### Accessibility

- Progress has a `role` set to `progressbar` to denote that it's a progress`
- Progress has `aria-valuenow` set to the percentage completion value passed to
  the component, to ensure the progress percent is visible to screen readers.

## UX Guideline

As a general rule of thumb, you should use a progressbar for longer processes
that take 10 or more seconds. Based on
[Jakob Nielsen’s research](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/response-times-3-important-limits/)
about response times, after 10 seconds, users quickly grow impatient if they
don’t have an idea how many more steps they have to take until completion.
